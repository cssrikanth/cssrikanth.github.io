I am currently a PhD in Aeronautical and Space Engineering at Sapienza University of Rome. I am pursuing it under the supervision of Prof. Matteo Bernardini at the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.

My main PhD topic involves the study of the effect of surface roughness in supersonic turbulent fluid flows. To achieve this, I will be performing Direct Numerical Simulations using our research group's in-house code [STREAmS](https://github.com/matteobernardini/STREAmS). Apart from this, I am also mainly involved in extending our solver to use GPU resources from either NVIDIA or AMD architectures using HIP.

I am parallely involved in other research and personal projects. I would like to use this website to frequently update my progress. Also, I generally come across interesting things that I feel is worth sharing with others. You can find these [here](others).
