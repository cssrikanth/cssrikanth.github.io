I am currently a Postdoc at Max Planck Computing & Data Facility (MPCDF). I am part of the [Plasma-PEPSC](https://plasma-pepsc.eu/) project, a EuroHPC Center of Excellence project aimed at preparing four European flagship plasma codes for exascale. My main role for this project is to develop a block-structured grid library for the Gyrokinetic code [GENE](http://genecode.org/) used to perform Tokamok simulations.  

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Aeronautics and Space Engineering from Sapienza University of Rome. My PhD topic was aimed at studying distributed surface roughness in supersonic turbulent flows through Direct Numerical Simulations using the in-house code [STREAmS-2](https://github.com/STREAmS-CFD/STREAmS-2). Additionally, I developed a tool to automatically convert STREAmS-2 to any backends targeting NVIDIA (CUDA Fortran)/AMD (HIPFort) GPUs/CPU.

I am parallely involved in other research and personal projects. I would like to use this website to frequently update my progress. [Here](others) are some interesting resources that I feel are worth sharing.
