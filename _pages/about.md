I am a PhD student in Aeronautical and Space Engineering from Sapienza University of Rome, Italy. I am pursuing it under the supervision of Prof. Matteo Bernardini at the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.

I am currently working on the supersonic roughness problem as part of my PhD. It mainly involves understanding the physics behind supersonic flow over rough surfaces. For this, I will be using the in-house DNS code developed in my group. As a first step, we ported the existing MPI parallel code to hybrid CPU-GPU code. These flows exhibit high Reynolds number which requires high resolution of the grid which in turn demands high computational resource. The porting of the code was performed to mainly satisfy these requirements.

I am parallely involved in other research and personal projects. I would like to use this website to frequently update my progress. I generally come across interesting things that I really feel is worth sharing with others, you can find these [here](others).
