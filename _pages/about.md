I am currently a PhD student in Aeronautics and Space Engineering at Sapienza University of Rome. I am pursuing it under the supervision of Prof. Matteo Bernardini at the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.

My PhD topic involves the study of distributed surface roughness in supersonic turbulent fluid flows. To achieve this, I will be performing Direct Numerical Simulations(DNS) using our groups in-house code [STREAmS](https://github.com/matteobernardini/STREAmS). I am also involved in accelerating our solver to help perform large scale, computationally expensive DNS. Currently, I handle the development of Hipfort backend.

I am parallely involved in other research and personal projects. I would like to use this website to frequently update my progress. [Here](others) are some interesting resources that I feel are worth sharing.
