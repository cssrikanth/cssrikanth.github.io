I am currently a Postdoc at Max Planck Computing & Data Facility (MPCDF). I am part of the [Plasma-PEPSC](https://plasma-pepsc.eu/) project, a EuroHPC Center of Excellence project aimed at preparing four European flagship plasma codes for exascale. My role in this project is to develop a block-structured grid approach for the [GENE](http://genecode.org/) code family which is mainly used to perform Tokamak simulations.  

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Aeronautics and Space Engineering from Sapienza University of Rome. My PhD topic was aimed at studying distributed surface roughness effects in supersonic turbulent flows through Direct Numerical Simulations using our in-house code [STREAmS-2](https://github.com/STREAmS-CFD/STREAmS-2). Additionally, I developed a tool to automatically convert STREAmS-2 to any backends targeting NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA Fortran), AMD GPUs (HIPFort) and CPUs.

I am parallelly involved in other research and personal projects. I would like to use this website to frequently update my progress. [Here](others) are some interesting resources that I feel are worth sharing.
