I am a PhD student in Aeronautics and Space Engineering from Sapienza Universit√† di Roma, Italia. I mainly work on developing discrete adjoint solvers for steady and unsteady fluid flows which will be used in aerodynamic optimisations. I have considerable experience in developing finite volume and meshfree based CFD solvers. I am the main developer of the meshfree solver, [mfcfd](https://bitbucket.org/srikanthcs05/mfcfd/wiki/Home "Bitbucket"). 
						
I have a growing expertise in the fascinating field of High Performance Computing. I extensively use the routines and data structures from the 
open-source scientific computing tool [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/). Additionally, I develop GPU parallel solvers on which I have been working on for quite some time now and believe it has serious potential in accelerating CFD solvers efficiently. I mainly use FORTRAN 90 to develop my codes but I am open to explore possibilities in developing codes with modern languages like Julia and Python especially from a HPC point of view.
