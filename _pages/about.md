I am currently a PostDoc at Max Planck Computing & Data Facility (MPCDF). I am part of the [Plasma-PEPSC](https://plasma-pepsc.eu/) project, a EuroHPC Center of Excellence project aimed at preparing four European flagship plasma codes for exascale. My role in this project is to develop a block-structured grid approach for GENEX which is a Gyrokinetic turbulence code for the edge and scrape-off layer simulations for magnetic confinement fusion devices like Tokamak and Stellarator.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Aeronautics and Space Engineering from Sapienza University of Rome. My PhD topic was aimed at studying distributed surface roughness effects in supersonic turbulent flows through Direct Numerical Simulations using our in-house code [STREAmS-2](https://github.com/STREAmS-CFD/STREAmS-2). Additionally, I developed a tool to automatically convert STREAmS-2 to any backends targeting NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA Fortran), AMD GPUs (HIP) and CPUs.
